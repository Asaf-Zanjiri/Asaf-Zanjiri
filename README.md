- 👋 Hi, I’m @Asaf-Zanjiri
- 👀 I’m interested in Malware, Exploits and Vulnerabilities.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of: C++, Malware-Analysy, Reversing, Pentesting.

I've still got a long way to go, and I don't upload all of my works here. But you can always be sure that i'm always learning.
